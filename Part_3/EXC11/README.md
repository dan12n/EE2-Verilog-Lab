#Exercise 11

##Summary:

The purpose of this exercise is to show that there is a different method to convert Digital input to its analogue equivalent and that is using pulse width modulation. The output would again be verified using the oscilloscope.

##Method:

Similar to the previous exercise, the main addition module, pwm.v was given to us, and so this section was more about the testing. As spi2dac was left in the implementation, the output of each was compared at the end.


##Results and Conclusion:
