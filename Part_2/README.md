#Part 2

##Summary:

For Part 2, we were looking at counters and finite state machines through a number of exercises. We also looked at the idea of modeling and testbenches. This was particularly highlighted in exercise 5 where we implemented the given 8 bit binary counter, and using Modelsim saw a model of what we should see if testing this on the FPGA which could be a time-efficient asset to have in future large scale projects. Also a testbench was created, another good skill to acquire.

Exercise 6 was an extension with a 16 bit counter rather than the previous 8 bit, and to be dsiplayed on screen. The keys control this start and end of these counters. Also an extension task using a clock divider was required to slow down the speed of change to a more reasonable time for us to use.

The final non-optional exercise was exploring the idea of a pseudo-random binary sequence using an LFSR ofr 7 bits rather than the 4 bit one seen in the lectures. This was a simple adapting of that one.

The first optional task, exercise 8 was based on F1 lights with the LEDs lighting on every half a second once the key is pressed, and a random time after they are all on, all switch off, making use of the LFSR. This random delay provided by the LFSR should be displayed as an output.

Finally, exercise 9 was extending this so that a reaction time is displayed with the reaction calculated being the time between the lights going off and the user pushing the KEY[0] key.

Overall, part 2 was a lot more strenuous that part 1 with more components and aspects introduced, and more lifelike, large projects being produced, highlighted by the optionals.
