##Summary:

For this exercise, we were tasked with producing an echo with a fixed delay for the sounds heard using the earphones. We were given a signal flow graph to help with this and this basically showed that the output would be the input sound plus the input sound delayed and attenuated by multiplication by a constant. This would give the original sound and a quieter echo.
